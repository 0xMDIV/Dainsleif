# HACK4CSGO
Internal trainer for CSGO I've been working on as my training of reverse engineering and not completed yet.
Since I don't intend to make this a malicious software, this isn't considered to be performed in multiplayer mode. Keep in that mind plz.

STILL WORKING 08/07/2020

# Aimbot

**Press INSERT to enable**
If you turn it on, it will automatically lock aim at a closest enemy unless you step really away from him.
When you are away enough from enemies you get the control of angle back.

- [x] Check if bDormant is true
- [x] Aiming smoother rather than instantly stick crosshair to the target
- [ ] Require more humanistic way to aim
- [ ] Aim at closest enemy based on the position of crosshair not physical distance so that user can move their angle most of the time

# Glow hack
**Press DELETE to enable**
This feature allows you to see both opponents and teammate's outline through walls.

- [ ] want it to be capable of setting specific color of outline.

# Features being developed

- [x] Aimbot
- [x] Glow hack
- [ ] GUI menu for more better user experience (by hooking Directx9 endScene function)
- [ ] Enemy's health indicator
- [ ] ESP (drow line by myself)
- [ ] teleport hack (not sure if it's possible without getting detected)
